DPIR-1#1 Warning
Asynchronous driver check  
DSP hdmi_ctrl_inst/hdmi_stream_inst/data_pos_out_reg input pin hdmi_ctrl_inst/hdmi_stream_inst/data_pos_out_reg/A[0] is connected to registers with an asynchronous reset. This is preventing the possibility of merging these registers in to the DSP Block since the DSP block registers only possess synchronous reset capability.
